Stock Market Price Prediction
Overview
Stock Market Price Prediction is a machine learning project designed to forecast stock prices using various machine learning algorithms. This project aims to provide accurate predictions to help investors make informed decisions. By analyzing historical stock data, the model can predict future stock prices and identify trends.

Features
Data Collection: Retrieves historical stock price data from financial APIs.
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the data to ensure quality and relevance.
Feature Engineering: Extracts relevant features to improve model accuracy.
Model Training: Implements and trains various machine learning models for price prediction.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Visualization: Provides visualizations of predicted vs. actual stock prices for better insights.
Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
Financial APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage): For retrieving historical stock price data.
